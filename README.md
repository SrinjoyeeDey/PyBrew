# 🔧 How It Works

1️⃣ The machine has limited resources – water, milk, and coffee beans.
2️⃣ You insert coins to pay (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies).
3️⃣ If the machine has enough ingredients and you insert the correct amount, it brews your coffee!
4️⃣ Need a refill? Admins can replenish stock and check machine stats.
5️⃣ Want to exit? Just type "off" to shut down the machine!
